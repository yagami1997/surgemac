# > Zhihu IP Ranges - For APP IP Location Display ⭐

IP-CIDR,47.94.0.0/16,no-resolve  # Aliyun Beijing - Zhihu API servers

IP-CIDR,121.196.0.0/16,no-resolve  # Zhihu image CDN
IP-CIDR,121.199.0.0/16,no-resolve  # Zhihu image CDN backup

# ========================================
# Xiaohongshu - Lifestyle Sharing Platform ⭐ IP Control
# ========================================
# Also known as RED, a lifestyle and social e-commerce platform
# Ultra-optimized strategy: Minimal rules for maximum performance

# > Domain Rules (Comprehensive for OpenClash compatibility)
DOMAIN-SUFFIX,xiaohongshu.com  # All Xiaohongshu domains (ensure Surge handles ALL requests)
DOMAIN,fe-video-qc.xhscdn.com  # Frontend video processing (non-CDN)

# > IP Rules (Balanced - moderate coverage for stability)
IP-CIDR,223.109.0.0/19,no-resolve  # Xiaohongshu core API cluster (8,192 IPs - balanced)
IP-CIDR,103.41.160.0/21,no-resolve  # Xiaohongshu API backend (2,048 IPs - covers 160-167 range)

# ⚠️ OPENCLASH-COMPATIBLE STRATEGY:
# 1. DOMAIN-SUFFIX for xiaohongshu.com - ensure Surge handles ALL requests (comments, emojis, etc)
# 2. Safe to use SUFFIX - xiaohongshu.com doesn't include xhscdn.com (different domains)
# 3. NO User-Agent rules - they match ALL requests including CDN (performance killer!)
# 4. Moderate IP ranges - /19 and /21 (balanced coverage vs performance)
# 5. xhscdn.com CDN → DIRECT for best performance (domestic nodes)
