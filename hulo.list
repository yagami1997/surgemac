# ========================================
# Xiaohongshu - Lifestyle Sharing Platform ⭐ IP Control
# ========================================
# Also known as RED, a lifestyle and social e-commerce platform
# Optimized strategy: Proxy business API only, let CDN direct connect

# > User-Agent Rules (APP identification)
USER-AGENT,*xiaohongshu*  # Xiaohongshu APP
USER-AGENT,*redbook*  # International version

# > Domain Rules (Business API only)
DOMAIN-SUFFIX,xiaohongshu.com  # Main domain (covers all subdomains: www, api, edith, etc.)

# > IP Rules (Critical service IPs only - for accurate IP display)
# Only the most essential IPs to prevent IP leakage when accessing by IP
IP-CIDR,223.109.0.0/16,no-resolve  # Xiaohongshu primary service IP
IP-CIDR,103.41.0.0/16,no-resolve  # Xiaohongshu API backend

# ⚠️ IMPORTANT: xhscdn.com (CDN) is NOT proxied - DIRECT CONNECT for best performance
# Reasons:
# 1. CDN has domestic nodes - proxying causes "China → Overseas → Back to China" routing
# 2. Direct connect is faster and more stable
# 3. CDN does not affect IP location display (IP is determined by API requests)
# 4. Avoid double-proxy issue when used with router-level proxy (OpenClash, etc.)
