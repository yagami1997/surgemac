# Ultra-optimized strategy: Minimal rules for maximum performance

# > Domain Rules (Extended API coverage - precise domains only)
DOMAIN,www.xiaohongshu.com  # Main website
DOMAIN,api.xiaohongshu.com  # Core API - determines IP location
DOMAIN,edith.xiaohongshu.com  # Editor API (for posting)
DOMAIN,edith-seb.xiaohongshu.com  # Editor API (for posting)
DOMAIN,customer.xiaohongshu.com  # Customer service API
DOMAIN,fe-video-qc.xhscdn.com  # Frontend video processing (non-CDN)
DOMAIN,sns.xiaohongshu.com  # Social network services
DOMAIN,ci.xiaohongshu.com  # Image processing/upload
DOMAIN,referee.xiaohongshu.com  # Referral/recommendation system

# > Xiaohongshu IP Ranges - For APP IP Location Stability ⭐
# Note: Selected core IP segments to prevent "IP drop" in persistent connections
# Purpose: Ensure proxy IP remains stable during posting/commenting sessions
#
# Why IP rules are needed:
# - Xiaohongshu APP uses long-lived HTTP/2 connections
# - Domain-only rules trigger at DNS resolution (connection start)
# - After connection established, domain rules may not re-evaluate
# - IP rules work at network layer, match every packet (including existing connections)
#
# Strategy: Use /16 segments (same as Zhihu) with extended coverage for maximum stability

# > Xiaohongshu Core Service IPs (Primary)
IP-CIDR,101.132.0.0/16,no-resolve   # Aliyun Shanghai - XHS main API servers
IP-CIDR,106.52.0.0/16,no-resolve    # Tencent Cloud Beijing - XHS API backend
IP-CIDR,117.184.0.0/16,no-resolve   # XHS core services (publish/comment/feed)
IP-CIDR,183.131.0.0/16,no-resolve   # XHS mobile APP API endpoints

# > Xiaohongshu Extended Service IPs (Additional Coverage)
IP-CIDR,42.81.0.0/16,no-resolve     # Aliyun backup segment - secondary API
IP-CIDR,47.103.0.0/16,no-resolve    # Aliyun East China - extended services
IP-CIDR,120.27.0.0/16,no-resolve    # XHS API extension segment

# Total coverage: ~459K IPs (7 × /16 segments)
# Trade-off: Wider coverage for IP stability (priority: prevent IP drops)
# Benefit: Maximum protection against long-connection IP leaks
