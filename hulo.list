# > This ruleset contains rules for Chinese social media platforms
# > Included: Zhihu and Xiaohongshu (RED)
# > Use this ruleset to route traffic through proxy for better performance

# ========================================
# Zhihu - Q&A Community Platform ⭐ IP Control
# ========================================
# China's largest question-and-answer platform
# Purpose: Control IP location display for posts and comments

# > User-Agent Rules
USER-AGENT,*zhihu*
USER-AGENT,zhihu*
USER-AGENT,*ZhihuHybrid*  # Zhihu APP hybrid framework

DOMAIN-KEYWORD,zhihu

# > Zhihu IP Ranges - For APP IP Location Display ⭐
# Note: Carefully selected to avoid conflicts with Xiaohongshu

# > Zhihu Main Service IPs (Aliyun Beijing)
IP-CIDR,47.94.0.0/16,no-resolve  # Aliyun Beijing - Zhihu API servers
IP-CIDR,47.95.0.0/16,no-resolve  # Aliyun Beijing - Zhihu web services

# > Zhihu CDN IPs (Aliyun Hangzhou)
IP-CIDR,47.96.0.0/16,no-resolve  # Aliyun Hangzhou zone A
IP-CIDR,47.97.0.0/16,no-resolve  # Aliyun Hangzhou zone B
IP-CIDR,47.98.0.0/16,no-resolve  # Aliyun Hangzhou zone C

# > Zhihu Image CDN (zhimg.com)
IP-CIDR,121.196.0.0/16,no-resolve  # Zhihu image CDN
IP-CIDR,121.199.0.0/16,no-resolve  # Zhihu image CDN backup

# > Zhihu API Servers (Specific)
IP-CIDR,106.75.0.0/16,no-resolve  # Zhihu API backend
IP-CIDR,120.55.0.0/16,no-resolve  # Zhihu API backend backup

# > Zhihu Video CDN
IP-CIDR,121.43.0.0/16,no-resolve  # Zhihu video CDN

# ========================================
# Xiaohongshu - Lifestyle Sharing Platform ⭐ IP Control
# ========================================
# Also known as RED, a lifestyle and social e-commerce platform
# Ultra-optimized strategy: Minimal rules for maximum performance

# > Domain Rules (Precise API domains + wildcard fallback)
DOMAIN,www.xiaohongshu.com  # Main website
DOMAIN,api.xiaohongshu.com  # Core API - determines IP location
DOMAIN,edith.xiaohongshu.com  # Editor API (for posting)
DOMAIN,customer.xiaohongshu.com  # Customer service API
DOMAIN,fe-video-qc.xhscdn.com  # Frontend video processing (non-CDN)
DOMAIN-SUFFIX,xiaohongshu.com  # Fallback: catch all subdomains (creator/profile/sns/community)

# > IP Rules (Core API servers - ensure stable IP display)
IP-CIDR,223.109.0.0/16,no-resolve  # Xiaohongshu primary service cluster (expanded for stability)
IP-CIDR,103.41.0.0/16,no-resolve  # Xiaohongshu API backend (expanded for complete coverage)

# ⚠️ BALANCED STRATEGY:
# 1. NO User-Agent rules - prevent CDN from being proxied
# 2. 5 precise DOMAIN rules + wildcard fallback - cover creator pages & comments
# 3. /16 IP ranges - wider coverage to prevent "IP drop" issues
# 4. xhscdn.com CDN → DIRECT for best performance (domestic nodes)
# 5. Trade-off: Slightly broader matching for comprehensive coverage
