# > IP Rules (Expanded - wider coverage for WiFi stability)
IP-CIDR,223.109.0.0/16,no-resolve  # Xiaohongshu core API cluster (65,536 IPs - expanded for WiFi)
IP-CIDR,103.41.0.0/16,no-resolve  # Xiaohongshu API backend (65,536 IPs - full range coverage)

# ⚠️ OPTIMIZED STRATEGY FOR WIFI STABILITY:
# 1. NO User-Agent rules - they match ALL requests including CDN (performance killer!)
# 2. NO DOMAIN-SUFFIX - causes image loading errors
# 3. EXPANDED IP ranges - /16 (131K IPs total) for WiFi environment stability
# 4. EXTENDED domain coverage - 8 precise domains (API + services)
# 5. xhscdn.com CDN → handled by OpenClash DIRECT for best performance
# 6. Trade-off: Wider IP coverage for stable IP display in WiFi environments
