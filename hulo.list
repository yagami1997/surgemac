# Note: Carefully selected to avoid conflicts with Xiaohongshu

# > Zhihu Main Service IPs (Aliyun Beijing)
IP-CIDR,47.94.0.0/16,no-resolve  # Aliyun Beijing - Zhihu API servers

# ========================================
# Xiaohongshu - Lifestyle Sharing Platform ⭐ IP Control
# ========================================
# Also known as RED, a lifestyle and social e-commerce platform
# Ultra-optimized strategy: Minimal rules for maximum performance

# > Domain Rules (Precise API domains only)
DOMAIN,www.xiaohongshu.com  # Main website
DOMAIN,api.xiaohongshu.com  # Core API - determines IP location
DOMAIN,edith.xiaohongshu.com  # Editor API (for posting)
DOMAIN,customer.xiaohongshu.com  # Customer service API
DOMAIN,fe-video-qc.xhscdn.com  # Frontend video processing (non-CDN)

# > IP Rules (Minimal - only for IP-based connections)
IP-CIDR,223.109.0.0/20,no-resolve  # Xiaohongshu core API (narrowed from /16)
IP-CIDR,103.41.167.0/24,no-resolve  # Xiaohongshu API gateway (precise range)

# ⚠️ PERFORMANCE OPTIMIZATIONS:
# 1. NO User-Agent rules - they match ALL requests including CDN (performance killer!)
# 2. NO DOMAIN-SUFFIX - too broad, may catch CDN subdomains
# 3. Narrowed IP ranges - /20 and /24 instead of /16 (less false positives)
# 4. xhscdn.com CDN → DIRECT for best performance (domestic nodes)
# 5. Only 5 precise domains + 2 narrow IPs = fastest matching
