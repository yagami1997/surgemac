# > Use this ruleset to route traffic through proxy for better performance

# ========================================
# Zhihu - Q&A Community Platform ⭐ IP Control
# ========================================
# China's largest question-and-answer platform

# > User-Agent Rules
USER-AGENT,*zhihu*
USER-AGENT,zhihu*
USER-AGENT,*ZhihuHybrid*  # Zhihu APP hybrid framework
USER-AGENT,*osee*  # Zhihu internal codename

# > Domain Rules
DOMAIN,api.zhihu.com  # Zhihu API - Critical for APP (must be first!)
DOMAIN-SUFFIX,zhihu.com  # Main domain (includes all subdomains: www, link, etc.)
DOMAIN-SUFFIX,zhimg.com  # Zhihu image CDN (pic1.zhimg.com, pic2.zhimg.com, etc.)
DOMAIN-KEYWORD,zhihu

# > Zhihu IP Ranges - For APP IP Location Display ⭐
# Note: Carefully selected to avoid conflicts with Xiaohongshu

# > Zhihu Main Service IPs (Aliyun Beijing)
IP-CIDR,47.94.0.0/16,no-resolve  # Aliyun Beijing - Zhihu API servers
IP-CIDR,47.95.0.0/16,no-resolve  # Aliyun Beijing - Zhihu web services

# > Zhihu CDN IPs (Aliyun Hangzhou)
IP-CIDR,47.96.0.0/16,no-resolve  # Aliyun Hangzhou zone A
IP-CIDR,47.97.0.0/16,no-resolve  # Aliyun Hangzhou zone B
IP-CIDR,47.98.0.0/16,no-resolve  # Aliyun Hangzhou zone C

# > Zhihu Image CDN (zhimg.com)
IP-CIDR,121.196.0.0/16,no-resolve  # Zhihu image CDN
IP-CIDR,121.199.0.0/16,no-resolve  # Zhihu image CDN backup

# > Zhihu API Servers (Specific)
IP-CIDR,106.75.0.0/16,no-resolve  # Zhihu API backend
IP-CIDR,120.55.0.0/16,no-resolve  # Zhihu API backend backup

# > Zhihu Video CDN
IP-CIDR,121.43.0.0/16,no-resolve  # Zhihu video CDN

# ========================================
# Xiaohongshu - Lifestyle Sharing Platform ⭐ IP Control
# ========================================
# Also known as RED, a lifestyle and social e-commerce platform
# Ultra-optimized strategy: Minimal rules for maximum performance

# > Domain Rules (Precise API domains only - OpenClash compatible)
DOMAIN,www.xiaohongshu.com  # Main website
DOMAIN,api.xiaohongshu.com  # Core API - determines IP location
DOMAIN,edith.xiaohongshu.com  # Editor API (for posting)
DOMAIN,customer.xiaohongshu.com  # Customer service API
DOMAIN,fe-video-qc.xhscdn.com  # Frontend video processing (non-CDN)

# ⚠️ DOMAIN-ONLY STRATEGY (NO IP RULES):
# 1. NO IP-CIDR rules - they conflict with OpenClash and slow down CDN
# 2. Only precise DOMAIN rules - ensures API requests get proxied
# 3. NO User-Agent rules - they match ALL requests including CDN
# 4. NO DOMAIN-SUFFIX - too broad, breaks image loading
# 5. Result: Fast CDN (DIRECT), stable IP display (API proxied)
