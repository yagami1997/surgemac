DOMAIN-SUFFIX,zhimg.com  # Zhihu image CDN (pic1.zhimg.com, pic2.zhimg.com, etc.)
DOMAIN-KEYWORD,zhihu

# > Zhihu IP Ranges - For APP IP Location Display ⭐
# Note: Carefully selected to avoid conflicts with Xiaohongshu

# > Zhihu Main Service IPs (Aliyun Beijing)
IP-CIDR,47.94.0.0/16,no-resolve  # Aliyun Beijing - Zhihu API servers
IP-CIDR,47.95.0.0/16,no-resolve  # Aliyun Beijing - Zhihu web services

# > Zhihu CDN IPs (Aliyun Hangzhou)
IP-CIDR,47.96.0.0/16,no-resolve  # Aliyun Hangzhou zone A
IP-CIDR,47.97.0.0/16,no-resolve  # Aliyun Hangzhou zone B
IP-CIDR,47.98.0.0/16,no-resolve  # Aliyun Hangzhou zone C

# > Zhihu Image CDN (zhimg.com)
IP-CIDR,121.196.0.0/16,no-resolve  # Zhihu image CDN
IP-CIDR,121.199.0.0/16,no-resolve  # Zhihu image CDN backup

# ========================================
# Xiaohongshu - Lifestyle Sharing Platform ⭐ IP Control
# ========================================
# Also known as RED, a lifestyle and social e-commerce platform
# Ultra-minimal strategy: Optimized for OpenClash double-proxy environment

# > Domain Rules (API-only - most stable for OpenClash)
DOMAIN,www.xiaohongshu.com  # Main website
DOMAIN,api.xiaohongshu.com  # Core API - determines IP location
DOMAIN,edith.xiaohongshu.com  # Editor API (for posting)
DOMAIN,customer.xiaohongshu.com  # Customer service API
DOMAIN,fe-video-qc.xhscdn.com  # Frontend video processing (non-CDN)

# ⚠️ OPENCLASH-OPTIMIZED STRATEGY:
# 1. NO User-Agent rules - avoid CDN matching
# 2. NO DOMAIN-SUFFIX - avoid broad subdomain conflicts
# 3. NO IP-CIDR rules - cause severe routing conflicts in OpenClash environment!
# 4. Only precise DOMAIN rules - most stable in double-proxy setup
# 5. Trade-off: IP display may be less precise, but won't drop proxy connection
#
# Why NO IP rules?
# - OpenClash (router) + Surge (device) = double-proxy routing
# - IP-CIDR rules conflict with router-level routing table
# - Result: proxy connection drops frequently
# - Solution: Domain-only routing is most stable
