# Rules Reference

This repository no longer treats the root directory as a rules publishing surface.

## Mainline Rules

Use the 2026 mainline under `neorulset26/`.

Primary references:

- `neorulset26/ENGINEERING_GUIDE.md`
- `neorulset26/RULESET_URLS.md`
- `neorulset26/MIGRATION_RULE_URLS.md`

## Legacy Rules

The former `archive/legacy/` transition surface (historical root rules and the old `ruleset/` tree) was fully removed on May 16, 2026 (PDT). Historical publication paths are no longer mirrored in this repository.

## Current Rule Ownership

- Active maintained rules: `neorulset26/`
- Local-only sensitive OpenClash rewrite files: `openclash-archive/` (not tracked by Git)

## Guidance

- For reviewing the active configuration mainline, refer to `neorulset26/`.
- Do not add new published configuration artifacts to the repository root.
- Do not reintroduce a legacy mirror; downstream consumers should migrate to paths listed in `neorulset26/RULESET_URLS.md`.
