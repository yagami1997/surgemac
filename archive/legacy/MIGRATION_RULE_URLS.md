## Ruleset Migration

Most files under `archive/legacy/ruleset/` map directly to the same relative path under `neorulset26/ruleset/`.

Base migration rule:

```text
archive/legacy/ruleset/<path>.list
-> neorulset26/ruleset/<path>.list
```

Examples:

```text
archive/legacy/ruleset/AdBlock.list
-> neorulset26/ruleset/AdBlock.list

archive/legacy/ruleset/Proxy.list
-> neorulset26/ruleset/Proxy.list

archive/legacy/ruleset/Media/Netflix.list
-> neorulset26/ruleset/Media/Netflix.list
```

## Notes

- The legacy archive exists only for transition.
- New users should not adopt the legacy paths.
- Sensitive OpenClash rewrite files are intentionally excluded from this document because they are local-only and not tracked by Git.
